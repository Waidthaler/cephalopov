<h4>CephaloPOV Scene Graph</h4>

<p>Master objects are defined relative to the origin. More precisely, the origin is
their primary point of articulation. In each frame, they are transformed to
their current frame-state.</p>

Possibly, a relationship between A and B is stated in the form of B's point of
articulation relative to some explicit or implicit point in A. In its most basic
form, this would amount to free movement of B relative to its attachment point
to A. PSII could provide a set of standard constraints, e.g., ball joint, hinge,
track, etc., which could be built upon or supplanted by the user.

This suggests a separate assembly process for objects with moving parts, which
means that ordinary native CSG objects can go ahead just fine. Converting them
into master objects amounts to just positioning them appropriately relative to
the origin after construction.
