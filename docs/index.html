<h2>TODO</h2>

<h3>Milestone C0</h3>

<pre>Type coercion
    Accept arrays with the appropriate number and type of elements as vectors and matrices in setters
    Special constructor arguments, esp Matrix operations
    reqTest in snippets for use in toSDL methods, or maybe revalidate
    Get SDL vector or SDL function out of vector params automatically
    Add toSDL alias 'toString' to SDL function params

Matrix
    rotate and skew

parent/child updates for CSG, blobs, sphere sweeps, parametrics, etc.; subcomponents generally
CSG output

Frame output routine

</pre>

[use --preamble or --sdlIncludes for atmospheric effects until implemented]

<h3>Milestone C1</h3>

<pre>copy() method across classes, both shallow and deep
Remaining primitives
    snippet: isoSurface.toSDL -- need to examine examples of functions
    snippet: mesh.toSDL
    snippet: mesh2.toSDL
    snippet: polynomial.toSDL
Wrap Array attributes with Proxies to enforce type
Matrix, Vector, Color
    Use JS/SDL func in lieu of individual attributes
Reorg
    Move things needed for codegen to separate file not included at runtime
    Script to pretty-print definition files
Camera pseudo-primitive transform integration
codegen
    Documentation generation
    Reports
Regression tests
Primitive
    .photons
    .radiosity
ImageOptions
    boundingThreshold: convert zero to boolean on output
    constants: gets special handling
    endColumn: post check startColumn
    endRow: post check startRow
    startColumn: post check endColumn
    startRow: post check endRow
Execution
    Optionally generate .sh/.bat files
    Oversee execution directly
</pre>


<h3>Backlog</h3>

<pre>Output frame range
Additional splines, easing functions, esp. Catmull-Rom
Interior
Texture
Macro/Function generation, i.e., in separate file to use directly with POV-Ray
Color and texture SDL generation, i.e., in separate file to use directly with POV-Ray
Script to parse as much as possible of POV-Ray .inc files into JS/cpov
Porting of functions in .inc files
Drag in some color libraries, theme generators
Atmospheric effects
Spline-builder UI
Stereo pseudo-cameras
Parametric types
Polyhedron library
Level-of-Detail
Particle systems
Geometric query system
    Eric Haines' table of object intersections, collision detection
Primitive
    tick order
    .materialize -- i.e., copy, executing JS funcs to produce fixed values
Direct support for ffmpeg
Script execution on events
Extensive warn, info, debug output</pre>


<h4>CephaloPOV Scene Graph</h4>

<p>Master objects are defined relative to the origin. More precisely, the origin is
their primary point of articulation. In each frame, they are transformed to
their current frame-state.</p>

Possibly, a relationship between A and B is stated in the form of B's point of
articulation relative to some explicit or implicit point in A. In its most basic
form, this would amount to free movement of B relative to its attachment point
to A. PSII could provide a set of standard constraints, e.g., ball joint, hinge,
track, etc., which could be built upon or supplanted by the user.

This suggests a separate assembly process for objects with moving parts, which
means that ordinary native CSG objects can go ahead just fine. Converting them
into master objects amounts to just positioning them appropriately relative to
the origin after construction.
